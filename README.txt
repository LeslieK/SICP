SICP (MIT's Structure and Interpretion of Computer Programs)

1. I am most proud of solving the Eight Queens Problem.
2. I finally have more than a superficial understanding of data abstraction. I'm starting to feel it in my gut.
3. Learned TONS from working on SICP during Hacker School. A subset of what I learned:
scheme (as much as presented through chapter 2)
the basics of functional programming
barriers of abstraction
data abstraction - data **can** be represented as procedures, not just as something contained in data structures
a recursive procedure can evolve as a recursive process or an iterative process
understand tail recursion now
more practice with estimating order of growth -- in both time and space

I definitely spent many intense hours pondering this material.
Fortunately I had the luxury of having the hours to do it.
I love this stuff.
Will miss my Hacker School F'13 study group!
